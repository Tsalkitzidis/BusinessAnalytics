Repo for the final project of course 42577 Introduction to Business Analytics at DTU

This repository contains the solution to the final project of the course 42577 Introduction to Business Analytics at the Technical University of Denmark and was a collaborative effort made by Laurids Joos Mikkelsen, Jonas Peter Winberg Waaben and Kiriakos Tsalkitzidis. 

The first part of the notebook is concerned with preparing the dataset for further analysis and descriptive statistics to get a deeper understanding of the data. This entails looking for wrong values, outliers, irregularities, NaN treatment and more.

The second part of the notebook will focus on a prediction challenge where the goal is to predict the ‘CO2 Emissions per Capita (metric tonnes)’ for the cities provided in the dataset. The predictions consist of two parts where the first one will do a training and test set split of 75% and 25% respectively, while the second part will have a test set consisting of all the cities that are within North and South America and the training set will consist of the cities from the rest of the world. 

The third part of the notebook will focus on the exploratory part of the data science challenge. Here we have formulated the following research questions that we want to explore further.

1.	Can we use regression to predict the modeshare missing values and based on the modeshare percentages determine the main mode of transport in a city?
2.	Is it possible to predict road deaths per 1000 based on a city's infrastructure and mobility patterns by using a neural network? Giving us possibly a strong indication on how the infrastructure influences road deaths and subsequently a call for action.
3.	Can the cities be clustered in a way that yield further meaningful insights?

Through research, visualization and reflection we attempt to answer these questions and some interesting connections are drawn between the amount of road deaths in a city and the wealth, infrastructure and transportation modes of that said city.
